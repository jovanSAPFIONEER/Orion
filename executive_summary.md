## Small‑world rewiring sweep (finalized)

- Objective: quantify how communication structure (small_world rewiring p) modulates masking thresholds under backward-only masking.
- Result: U‑shaped threshold curve with an optimum around rewire probability p ≈ 0.40.
- Point estimate (filtered spline, s=0.02; ceilings 48/64 excluded):
	- rewire_p* ≈ 0.400
	- threshold* ≈ 2.0 SOA
- Bootstrap 95% CI (B=2000; per‑seed resampling; ceilings 48/64 excluded):
	- rewire_p* ∈ [0.339, 0.400]
	- threshold* ∈ [−0.384, 2.122] (negatives indicate smooth-fit overshoot; interpret as ≈0)
- Artifacts:
	- Figures: `runs/rewire_sweep_dense/rewire_threshold_curve.png|pdf`, `rewire_threshold_curve_spline.png|pdf`, `spline_min_bootstrap.png|pdf`
	- Report: `runs/rewire_sweep_dense/spline_min_bootstrap.txt`

## Final comparison: structure vs size

- Per-size thresholds (0.5 accuracy crossing) computed: see `runs/size_thresholds/size_thresholds.csv` and `size_thresholds.png`.
- Side-by-side summary figure and CSV: `runs/size_thresholds/structure_vs_size_thresholds.png` and `structure_vs_size_thresholds.csv`.
- Conclusion: Structure changes drive threshold shifts far larger than size changes; optimum at p≈0.400 yields ≈2.0 SOA vs ≈5–8 SOA across sizes.
