Bootstrap spline minimum for Threshold vs RewireP
============================================================
B = 2000  smoothing=0.02  grid=5001  seed=1234
Filtered exact per-seed thresholds equal to: [48.0, 64.0]
Rewire levels: 7  Seeds per level (min/median/max): 8/8/8
Point estimate:
  rewire_p* ~ 0.400  threshold* ~ 2.000
95% CI (bootstrap percentiles):
  rewire_p*: [0.339, 0.400]
  threshold*: [-0.384, 2.122]
